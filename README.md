# FuckGlow
Ever wondered what Geometry Dash levels would look like without glow? Here you go!

Made with much-appreciated help from:
- cgytrus and matcool (meaningful function hooking)
- dankmeme01 and Firee (CCSprite hiding strategy + general C++ syntax wrangling)
- ItsLever (disabling Gradient trigger strategy)
- poweredbypie (Gradient trigger conditional statement code golf)

Disclaimers:
- Some features may not be available for macOS or Android.
- This does not affect overall game performance; the glows are simply invisible.
